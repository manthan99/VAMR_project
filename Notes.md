## Open Questions

- Essential Matrix vs Fundamental Matrix
  - Does not matter

- How to handle scale invariance
  - It does not need to be scaled correctly

- Matlab Libraries that are allowed
- In Matlab [Example](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/vision/ug/structure-from-motion-from-two-views.html) They detected more image points with lower the detection threshold after already relating to frames with KLT  (recovering R, t). Why is that?
